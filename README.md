### Brewery Locator with Dockerized MySQL Integration

Harnessing the power of an open-source Beer API, I've created a dynamic solution for showcasing breweries within user-specified locations. Adding a layer of sophistication, I employed Docker containers to seamlessly integrate a MySQL database, facilitating the storage of reviews for individual breweries within the system.

The integration of the Beer API allows users to explore breweries across diverse locations, offering a comprehensive view of the brewing landscape. By leveraging Docker containers, I ensured efficient and consistent deployment of the MySQL database, enhancing data management and accessibility for brewery reviews.

Delve into the codebase to witness this seamless fusion of API utilization and containerization, which showcases my ability to craft innovative and functional systems that bridge data retrieval and storage.
